  "bio": "I’m a Software Architect and Tech Lead with over a decade of experience building full-stack platforms that scale. I don’t just write code — I build systems, lead teams, and deliver results.\n\nI’ve led development efforts for high-stakes platforms like Opendorse (React, .NET 5, SQL Server), where we went from zero to MVP in 13 weeks — just in time to launch a revenue-generating NIL platform. For Cornerstone National Insurance, I designed and delivered a white-labeled mobile app on React Native integrated with their backend systems, giving policyholders instant access to documents, claims, and payments.\n\nI bring technical leadership and deep architectural insight to every project: from performance tuning APIs to mentoring teams and modernizing dev workflows. I’ve trained junior devs, defined engineering growth paths, and overhauled CI/CD pipelines to cut build times by more than 60%.\n\nClients trust me because I’m reliable, fast, and pragmatic. I communicate clearly, meet deadlines, and always look for ways to improve both the product and the process. If you need a partner who can handle the technical heavy lifting and lead your dev team with clarity and purpose — let’s talk.",
